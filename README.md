## Textfile Processing APITextfile Processing API

A Java API that provides the user various ways to perform transformations on a text file. Under development, it was an app built to be used from the command line with arguments specify each action. After completion, it was modified to also be used as an imported API. 

The goal of this project was not to create anything novel or special. It was to get more practice with Java and to learn more about Unit testing/JUnit, Test-Driven Development, Agile methodology, and API development. Over 100 tests were written to aid in the development of this API. 

The program can read in any text file and perform individual or combined actions such as: 
-Case-sensitive & insensitive substring search
-Case-sensitive & insensitive "Find & Replace" for substrings
-Deletion of sentences containing substrings
-Deletion of spaces and tabs
-Modification of lines with a prefix/suffix
-Automatic Line numbering

Changes could be previewed on the command line and saved to a new file.
